The LED linear trunking systems is a continuous row of lighting components that integrate a single lighting unit/sub-component with the backbone rail, which may include LED lighting modules, power supplies, lighting control, emergency battery packs and/or other functions. Flexible torso systems can be configured in a variety of variants to meet the challenging demands of commercial and industrial buildings for indoor lighting.

 

LED Linear Trunking Systems is a self-contained pre-wire backbone and LED lighting system, commonly known as continuous line lighting system. Engineering projects offer unparalleled flexibility in lighting layout and solution design. It is the perfect alternative to traditional linear and fluorescent tubes on the market and is a versatile and efficient continuous-row lighting system with a wide range of applications, providing intelligent solutions for any lighting task, from LED lighting lines to emergency lighting.

No wiring, 100pcs T8 tube wiring equals 10pcs linear module system.

The composition of the lighting system is uniform and continuous, without any visual interruption or different reflection effects.
